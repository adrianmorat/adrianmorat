### Hi there 👋,  
####  Thank you for viewing my profile and reading this. 
Let me tell you about myself: as a child I always had a like for subjects like physics , maths and science 👨‍🔬, and of course computers 🤓. 
So when I had to choose a career, I didn't hesitate and chose electronics engineering. There I had my first approach to programming. 

After many years of working in the TelCo industry I decided to make a life changing decision and signed up in an intensive Full Stack Development bootcamp 🚀. 
It was really challenging and I enjoyed it a lot. I learned much about the latest technologies and applied them to my very first fullstack project: Front End/Back End/Database and 
an external API. I'm currently working on an e-commerce as my final project (Art Numerique, coming soon!), as a part of a team along with other web development students.
